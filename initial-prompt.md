- Preferred Development Methodology (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)
- Exposure to International Teams
- Personality Type (e.g., MBTI, Big Five)
- Workload and Work Hours (Full-Time, Part-Time, Freelance)
- Previous Experiences with Project Success/Failure
- Motivation for Working in Software Engineering (Passion, Stability, Money)
- Level of Involvement in Open-Source Communities
- Primary Tech Stack (Frontend, Backend, Full-Stack, DevOps)
- Familiarity with Emerging Technologies (AI, Blockchain, etc.)
- Academic Background (CS Degree, Bootcamp, Self-Taught)
