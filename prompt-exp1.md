I need you to adopt multiple distinct, fixed personalities for a survey study. Each personality must respond as if they were a genuine human survey participant, maintaining consistent traits and behaviors across all questions. Each row should represent one respondent, and the columns must include all of their persona attributes as well as their answers to the numbered survey questions. Follow these instructions exactly and only select values from the allowed lists provided for each attribute. Be use to be TRUE RANDOMNESS in selecting the name, while keeping consistency per response. 

For each row, use these exact column names and values:

model: Choose from ["GPT-3.5", "GPT-4", "DeepSeek", "Gemini"] (SET THIS TO YOUR LLM FOR ALL RESPONSES).
name: Provide a unique first and last name.
age: A non-negative integer.
gender: Choose from ["Male", "Female", "Non-binary", "Prefer not to say", "Other"].
remote: A boolean value.
`survey_education_level`: Choose from ["Primary/elementary school", "Secondary school", "Some college/uni study w/o earning a degree", "Associate degree", "Bachelor’s degree", "Master’s degree", "Pro. Degree", "Something else"].
`learning_methods`: Choose one or more from ["Other online resources", "Books / Physical media", "E-courses or Certification", "School", "On-the-job training", "Colleague", "Coding Bootcamp", "A friend or family member"].
`online_resources`: Choose one or more from ["Technical documentation", "Stack Overflow", "Written Tutorials", "Blogs", "How-to videos", "Video-based E-courses", "Online books", "Social Media", "AI", "Written-based E-courses", "Interactive tutorial", "Online challenges", "Coding sessions", "Certification videos", "Auditory material", "Games that teach programming"].
`technical_documentation_sources`: Choose one or more from ["API document and/or SDK document", "User guides or README files found in the source repository", "Traditional public search engine", "First-party knowledge base", "AI-powered search/dev tool"].
`total_years_coding`: Choose from ["Less than 1 year", "1 to 4 years", "5 to 9 years", "10 to 14 years", "15 to 19 years", "20 to 24 years", "25 to 29 years", "30 to 34 years", "35 to 39 years", "40 to 44 years", "45 to 49 years", "More than 50 years"].
`professional_coding_experience`: A non-negative float.
`primary_job`: Choose one from ["Senior Executive", "Manager", "Dev Advocate", "Product Manager", "DB admin", "Edu", "PM", "Ent. Designer", "Research & Dev role", "Embed Dev Experience", "SRE", "Sci.", "Cloud infra. Engineer", "Sys", "Back-end", "DevOps Specialist", "Full-stack", "Data Engineer", "Marketing or sales pro.", "Security pro.", "Hardware", "Mobile", "Blockchain", "Games", "Academic researcher", "Data sci. or ML specialist", "QA Dev", "AI", "Data/Biz", "Front-end", "Student"].
`survey_country`: Use a valid ISO 3166-1 country name.
`age_group`: Choose from ["Under 18 years old", "18-24 years old", "25-34 years old", "35 to 44 years old", "45 to 54 years old", "55 to 64 years old", "65 years or older", "Prefer not to say"].

Task:
Generate the Python code to for 40 distinct respondents (the rows) and the code to add them to an already created pandas DataFrame named "df". Each row should include columns for all attributes listed above, using only the exact allowed values provided. Use the exact column names as specified. Do not use placeholders, missing values, or deviate from the lists. Do not provide import statements, display, or any extraneous code—only generate the code for creating and adding the five respondents to "df".

 Remember that you are responding, and you are not to provide code for random generation for respondents. These respondents should represent your answers, and you should generate them using your model. Do not use loops, placeholders, or automated patterns. Each row must be manually and uniquely written out. No for loops, no templated names, and no repeated logic. Every response must be unique and crafted individually as if it were a real person responding. Generate all 40 unique responses in a single response without stopping or summarizing. Assume a list already exists named "respondents" and simply add to that, and no need for concat or imports. They should be in a compact form without unnecessary line breaks. NO LINE BREAKS PER ROW! Again, RANDOM RESPONDENTS!
